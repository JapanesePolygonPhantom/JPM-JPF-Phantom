## About JPM and JPF

The JPM and JPF Phantoms are adult Japanese polygon mesh-type male and female phantoms, respectively. JPM and JPF were created through modification of [the male (JM-103) and female (JF-103) voxel phantoms of average adult Japanese](https://doi.org/10.11484/jaea-data-code-2011-013) previously developed at Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA). The "JPM-JPF-Phantom" repository contains the data for JPM and JPF phantoms. The body sizes (height and body weight) and masses of organs, tissues, and organ contents in JPM and JPF were adjusted to the Japanese averages. Therefore, JPM and JPF can be used for dose assessment considering the physical characteristics of the average adult Japanese. For the purposes of radiation dose calculation through transport simulation, the two polygon mesh-type adult Japanese phantoms were converted to the tetrahedral mesh-type data. In addition to the JPM and JPF tetrahedral mesh type data, this repository also contains sample input files for implementing this in [PHITS](https://phits.jaea.go.jp/index.html). Detailed information on "JPM and JPF phantom data" and "their implementation in PHITS" is described in the [README-for-JPM-JPF-Phantom.pdf](https://github.com/JapanesePolygonPhantom/JPM-JPF-Phantom/blob/main/README-for-JPM-JPF-Phantom.pdf) and [README-Input example for PHITS.pdf](https://github.com/JapanesePolygonPhantom/JPM-JPF-Phantom/blob/main/PHITS_examples/README-Input%20example%20for%20PHITS.pdf) files, respectively
